# smartphone-FastICA-demo
This is an Android Studio Project which implements the FastICA decomposition algorithm in smartphones

This Demo App contains: 
1. on-phone FFT (Fast Fourier Transform);
2. on-phone STFT (Short-time Fourier Transform);
3. on-phone CWT (Continuous wavelet transform);
      (#1-3 functions are from com.github.psambit9791.jdsp Java library)
4. on-phone FastICA algorithm (from 'SMILE' open-source Java statistics library).

The studies mainly explore the computational costs of processing a given simulated EEG signal on Android smartphones, which should be helpful for future mobile EEG processing studies.
